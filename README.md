React-JUCE is a hybrid JavaScript/C++ framework that enables a [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) UI for a [JUCE](http://juce.com/) application or plugin.

For more information, see the introductory blog post here: [Blueprint: A JUCE Rendering Backend for React.js](https://nickwritesablog.com/blueprint-a-juce-rendering-backend-for-react-js)

## Status

**Approaching Beta**. Maintenance/Development of React-JUCE has recently been taken over from Nick Thompson (original creator) by Joshua Marler.
The repository is going through a temporary restructure but we are pushing towards a stable v1.0. Updates will be posted once v1.0 is hit.

## Examples

React-JUCE is a young project, but already it provides the framework on which the entire user interface for [Creative Intent's Remnant](https://www.creativeintent.co/product/remnant) plugin is built.
